If you want to use this evaluation metric, you need prepare:
1. mtdataset/images/non-makeup
2. mtdataset/images/makeup
3. mt_removal
4. output_folder (the generated images)

The filenames of generated images should be as follows:
pred_0.png, pred_1.png, .....

The order of generated images are the makuep_test.txt and nomakup_test.txt.
For example, pred_0.png are generated by non-makeup/xfsy_0458.png and makeup/vHX44.png.
non-makeup/xfsy_0458.png and makeup/vHX44.png are the first line of nomakeup_test.txt and makup_test.txt, respectively.
